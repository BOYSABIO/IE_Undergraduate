"""Design a program where the user must guess a name.
    • The program will pick a name randomly from the following list of names: Albert, Anna,Charles, Sophia, 
    Susan, Robert, Alice
    • Each time the user is prompted to enter a name, the program should display the list of names that have not 
    been tried yet.
    • For example, if the first two attempts were Anna and Sophia then the message shouldread something like:
        o Guess what name I am thinking about. The remaining names are [Albert, Charles,Susan, Robert, Alice]:
        o Every time the user enters a name the program will:
            ▪ reply "incorrect" if the user did not guess the name
            ▪ reply "correct" if the user guessed the name
            • The program will keep asking for names until the user guesses the name correctly"""
